- 👋 Hi, I’m @ScruffJax
- 👀 I’m interested in learning coding and trying my hand at being a developer. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML5 and CSS, I've worked with HTML way before CSS, but need to learn the new skill.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, I'm a bit of a jack of all trades, so I just want to add to my skill.
- 📫 How to reach me at info.scruffjax@gmail.com  p.s. Scruff is no reflections on my work, just my dedication and long hours vs being clean shaved :)
